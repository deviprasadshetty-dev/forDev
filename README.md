**forDev** is a beautiful, clutter-free new tab page for developers who value privacy and performance. We believe developer news should be accessible, fast, and free from distractions.

> "No login, no clutter, no ads. Just the news you care about."

## 💡 The Philosophy

We were tired of bloated news aggregators that prioritize engagement algorithms over content. We were tired of "Sign up to read more" popups. We were tired of waiting for heavy React apps to load just to see a headline.

**So we built the alternative.**

forDev is built on three core pillars:
1.  **Respect**: We respect your time and your data. No tracking, no paywalls.
2.  **Performance**: We use vanilla technologies because a new tab page should load instantly.
3.  **Simplicity**: We strip away the noise so you can focus on the signal.

## ✨ Why Switch to forDev?

- 🚫 **No Login Required** - Install and start reading immediately. No accounts, no tracking.
- 🧹 **Zero Clutter** - A clean, focused interface designed for reading, not engagement metrics.
- 🛡️ **Privacy First** - Your data stays on your device. We don't track your reading habits.
- ⚡ **Blazing Fast** - Built with performance in mind. No heavy frameworks or bloat.
- 🔓 **Open Source** - Transparent and community-driven.
- 🎨 **Sleek Dark UI** - A modern, deep-dark theme that's easy on the eyes. Inspired by the best.
